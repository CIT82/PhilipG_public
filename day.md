# Philip Garcia's (*Mostly*) Daily Schedule

## Mornings
### Wake-up Around 6am to 8 am
1. Make breakfast to start the day (Maybe make some **coffee** whenever I have time)
2. Check on pets to see if they need more food or any medication to start their day
3. Check emails to see if there is anything important to do for school or other necessary tasks.

## Afternoons
### Mandatory Duties
- Check to see if I need to do any grocery shopping 
- Work on whatever **assignments/projects** that can be done with the time I have.
- Handle chores around the house to get them out of the way.

## Evenings

In the evenings, I usually check to see if I need to help make dinner for the family and talk with them to see how their day was.
If I end up with free time, I check and see if I can play any video games to wind down for the day.
If I'm not playing video games, I'm either listening to music or checking out videos from YouTube.
After that, I go to bed **no later than midnight**.
